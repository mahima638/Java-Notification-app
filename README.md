WhatsApp-Style Notification App (Java)

Developed as part of the Vedaz Software Development Internship Assignment

## 📱 Overview

This project demonstrates *real-time push notification functionality* similar to WhatsApp voice/video calls using *native Android (Java)*.

Since I am new to React Native, I built this project in native Java to ensure a complete and stable solution for the core requirement — *handling background/killed state notifications* with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).

## 📝 Note to Evaluators

While the assignment originally required a React Native implementation, I opted to build the application in Java due to my current skill set. My goal was to ensure a fully functional, working solution that meets the core objectives of the assignment.

I am actively learning React Native and am confident I can implement this using React Native modules in the near future.

Thank you for the opportunity!
